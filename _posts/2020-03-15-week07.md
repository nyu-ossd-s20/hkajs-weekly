title: Week 7 Online Classes
---

  This week NYU cancelled in-person classes until the next school year. It's really a lot to deal with and very stressful
as this is my final semester and this sudden change affects both the resources I and other students have access to and 
our ability to make some final interpersonal relationships in these final months. On the other hand, it is fortunate I am
taking Open Source as this class is perfect for teaching us how to communicate with projects over the internet rather than in
person, meaning that our learning in this class will not be too affected by this sudden change. I suspect it will
be harder to keep up in general with everything being moved online, including class itself, but in terms of actually
contributing to projects online we should be fine.

  The project that my group and I decided to contribute to is Godot, a highly versatile and powerful open source game
I think my group and I have similar passions in terms of gaming, so it should be a very interesting and fun project
for us to dip our toes into the open source world with. The primary obstacle right now is figuring out where and what we can
assist with. For now we know that they have some missing documentation so that should be a good starting point for us.
Hopefully by the end of the semester we should be able to put in some more difficult work in, but for now it's a good start.
