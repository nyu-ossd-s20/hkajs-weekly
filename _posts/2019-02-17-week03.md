title: Week 3 - Browser Extension
---

Both of my partners are very talented and were constantly updating/working on the extension. At first the extension seemed like it would have a pretty simple implementation, however very quickly the issue we ran into was regarding the logic on storing the websites that had been blocked by the user. There is javascript code to add url's to local storage, but I believe there was some issue where it would get erased somewhere in the code before the actual blocking need. I definitely feel like I made the easiest contributions, but it's a good feeling to know that even the small things need to be done, in my case it was making 2 icons, and a redirect page. I attempted to do the redirect logic in the javascript script, however I ran into problems with the concept of javascript promises and asynchronous inputs and what not, so in the end I really did not contribute too much but I still got something in which is great. Both of my partners killed it with the end result. The code was not working up until the presentation we did in class, literally minutes before class started, one of my partners figured out how to solve the issue with url storage.

I learned that I need to check my emails and slack more often, while both of my partners were shooting updates at eachother I didn't even realize that we had started. By the time I started working on the project, the entire ui and the basic idea behind the javascript script was already programmed. So definitely need to improve my communication with partners. I also realized that it's pretty important to be able to understand code written by other people, in this case my partner's javascript code while I was trying to set up the automatic redirect, which ultimately I did not figure out, but overall this experience was a good lesson in reading and understanding code so thats ok!

In terms of web design, I relearned a few basics, including being able to read/understand javascript, and write a very small amount of css and html. This is the first time I've ever experienced an iterative style of contributions by multiple group members. I am much better at sitting down with my groupmembers in person or getting on a discord call with them so that we can discuss and work on exactly the parts we have partitioned for eachother to do. So, I think it would be valuable to learn how to just step up and start coding away without full communications.

There were so many novel ideas that the other groups created, and all of them had polish or humor as an aspect of their extensions. Some of them I might even use, such as the dice roll/coin toss extension which is very well done. It's really interesting to see what can be done with javascript because I personally have never worked with it before, and at this point it seems very powerful. For instance the font replacer extension needed to brute force what fonts are available to one's computer, and I believe this was done in javascript, so honestly I'm thinking learning some javascript will be extremely helpful.
