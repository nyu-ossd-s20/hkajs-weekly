title: Week 12 - Getting Started on Contributing
---

   This week I had my first ever pull request to an open source project go through! It was a small fix for an issue unlikely to ever happen but even then the project maintaner thanked me for the fix and said nice catch :). At first I had my doubts about the possibility of us actually getting stuff done, but we got stuff done. I guess the hardest thing really is to find something to do, especially considering that most of the easy stuff is already done by the time people like us see a project. And the reason the hard stuff is hard is not because of the actual coding, but because it is hard to see what the project leads want for their project, and it's hard to even ask. The fix I put through was a side effect of working on an even bigger change to the project, one that I am still unsure the project maintaners even want. Regardless I am glad I even got something done, before getting into Inkle/Inky I had no experience with javascript so it is really nuts to say that the first thing I ever actually contributed to the world is a line of javascript. Hopefully the next thing I contribute to the world is multiple lines of javascript... perhaps even an entire function. I can't wait!
