This week we have presentations on our open source project contributions. This weekend we were suprised to see that the idea that one of
our group members had set out for us to work on had been completed by the project's main contributer. Furthermore he even expanded greatly
on the functionality of the proposed change. We had proposed to add a counter to give more information regarding the complexity of one's
program. The counter would give how many "knots" (essentially parts) that one's story contains, allowing the writer to gauge how much more
or less needs to be added to flesh out their story. The main contributer added both this, and any other type of quantitative counter possible
in the inky writing environment. While this leaves us at a roadblock again in terms of contributions, it is cool to see the idea one of
our members had figured out so greatly expanded on, to the point where the maintainer of the project decided to implement a better way
of getting the data of one's story, and edited the ui of the environment itself to foster this. Crazy stuff honestly. We have some ideas
of expanding this concept past what the maintainer had built, but we will not be able to figure this out before our presentations as he has
not merged his changes to the main branch yet. Hopefully we will figure this out soon though!
