title: Week 2: Browser Extension
---


Our project may be a throwaway, but we still figured out a cool and easy browser extension to make so I am pretty exicted, however, I feel that I am not sure what I can offer to the team I am in because they both seem to know what to do to make it work while I am unsure of how I could contribute. I am really bad at front-end anything, so hopefully I can work on the logic, but I am not great at javascript as in I have only used Node.js for logic. Currently, one of my group members, Jennifer, has been working on the UI, and decided that the best way to make this work is to use forms to add websites to block (our project is about blocking websites that distract you). My other teammate, Anthony, is working on the logic behind the forms. Because they are both very on task, I think that the browser extension should be good for the date set out. I am not great with web stuff, so I learned a little bit about that during the tutorial, but ideally tonight I'm going to make some real contributions after I study up on javascript.
